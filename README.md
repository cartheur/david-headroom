A new robotic head with an animated face

## The backstory

In 2015, a brilliant project called Poppy came onto the scene demonstrating the true power of 3D-printed designs for bipedal robots and that manufacturing of such robots could be done cheaply, effectively, and cost-efficiently to be able to reduce the cost-burden to the customer. This makes the idea of a bipedal robot with the behaviour of a child realistic to most buyers with a price-point somewhere in the 3-5k range.

## What is here

An attempt to adapt a new head to the robot that contains a plush face with animatronic eyes and mouth. I think that totallly digital robotic interfaces are not helpful at evolving the human-machine interface. They need to appear organic for humans to emotionally accept their presence and the level of intimacy they will ultimately provide. And people outside of that relationship should not be privy to any of it. Each of us needs to take our experience as it is and keep it memories stored on a robotic companion that is not shared with ANY external network. It is completely isolated from the Cloud.

How about that idea?
