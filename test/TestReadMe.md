Cartheur Solidworks Profile Test

Thanks for your time in the call today. In this folder are three figures I would iike to be modeled in Solidworks.

Please model them accroding to how you think it best. When I say 'best' how would you make these drawings such that they could be refined to be 3D-printed in a variety of materials including metal. When ready for review, return them by email. Any questions, feel free to contact me.

Keep track of your time spent on this task.

Good luck!
