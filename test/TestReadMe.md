Cartheur Solidworks Profile Test

Thanks for your time in the call today. In this folder are three figures I would like to be modeled in Solidworks.

Please model them according to how you think it best. When I say 'best' how would you make these drawings such that they could be refined to be 3D-printed in a variety of materials including metal. Please consider that the printer will be using other methods than a single downward-facing nozzle at print-bed, which will open your imagination of the kinds of engineering scenarios we confront at our company. The units are in mm but bear in-mind this design should be scalable.

When ready for review, return them by email. Any questions, feel free to contact me.

Keep track of your time spent on this task.

Good luck!
